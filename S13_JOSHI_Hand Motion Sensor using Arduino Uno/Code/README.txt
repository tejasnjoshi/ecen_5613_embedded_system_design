The Code folder contains 3 folders:

These folders must be placed in the following path:

C:\Users\Drix\Documents\Arduino\

Inside the Arduino folder place the three "sketches".


The ESD_Project file contains the .ino file which is used by the Arduino  IDE to burn into the falsh of the Arduino Uno


The next two folders have to be used in a pair

myorbit3game folder contains the ".pde" extension file which is to be executed using the Processing software once the ".ino" file present in the OrbitSensor folder is burned into the flash memory of the Arduino Uno.
